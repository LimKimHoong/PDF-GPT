# PDF-GPT

## Description
In this project, a chatbot has been created for any pdf file using Flask, a popular web framework, and the Langchain, another popular framework for working wtih Large Language Models (LLMs). The developed chatbot will not just interact with users via text but also comprehend and answer questions related to the content of a specific document (PDF).

## Usage 
The web-app is user-friendly in which simply upload a PDF file that you wish to analyse and summarize. Thus, we can ask any related question in the designated chatbox. 

## Tech Stack
PDF-GPT uses the following technologies:
- Flask
- Langchain
- HTML - CSS - Javascript

### Requirements
GitPython needs the `git` executable to be installed on the system and available in your `PATH` for most operations.
If it is not in your `PATH`, you can help GitPython find it by setting
the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE=<path/to/git>` environment variable.

- Git (1.7.x or newer)
- Python >= 3.7

The list of dependencies are listed in `./requirements.txt`.

The installer takes care of installing them for you.

## Install

GitPython and its required package dependencies can be installed as below: 

`pip3 install virtualenv`

`virtualenv my_env` # create a virtual environment my_env

`source my_env/bin/activate` # activate my_env
